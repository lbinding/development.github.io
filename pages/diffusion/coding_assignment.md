# Diffusion Coding Assignment
_by Anna Schroder_


```{admonition} Estimated Time 
:class: TIP
Around 2 hours to code
```



Great job making it this far! Now lets get onto the fun part! The image below will take you to a Google Colab, it is an online python notebook (which means no more pesky pip installs). Here there will be a coding assignment to estimate the diffusion in a single voxel. This is required before we can create our very own tractography algorithm. This assignment is developed for those who want to have a go at the code themselves, and those who wish to see the final product. We hope you enjoy!
