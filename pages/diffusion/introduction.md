# Introduction
_by Lawrence Binding_

The brain is the most complex network known. Gone are the days where we would attribute a single cortical region to function. Even simple moter functions requires integration of several cortical regions to ensure we can move without injury. 

A network by definition requires connections, the brain is no different. In the brain these connections are known as white matter fibres; interconnecting cortical grey matter. Thanks to the advancement of diffusion MRI, we are now able to image these fibres whereas before it would require dissection. 

But what is diffusion MRI?

- DPM is receiving increasing interest, exemplified by several large funded projects (H2020 EuroPOND, UK EPSRC C-PLACID, Predict-AD, Predict-ND, JPND E-DADS)
- Recent series of high-impact results: (Young - Nature Comms 2018; Oxtoby - Brain 2018; Lorenzi - ICML 2018; Garbarino - IPMI 2019 / NeuroImage 2021; Venkatraghavan - IPMI 2019; Pascuzzo - Acta Neuropathologica 2020; Wijeratne - ISMRM 2020; Eshaghi - Nature Comms 2021; Vogel - Nature Medicine 2021). 
- The field continues to expand, and many of the models are becoming established software, used by clinical partners for research on Alzheimer’s Disease (Lopez-Alvez - HAI 2018), multiple sclerosis (Eshaghi - Brain 2018; Nature Comms 2021), ageing (Vinke - Neurobiol. Aging 2018), Huntington’s disease (Wijeratne - ACTN 2018), and Parkinson’s disease (Iddi - NDD 2018; Oxtoby - CompAge 2020, Brain 2021).
