# UCL Summer School: Diffusion MRI 




Welcome to the University College London and centre for medical imaging and computing (CMIC) summer school! This is a week long course which aims to introduce you to complex topics so you can apply them to your own research. This course is focused on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), more specifically diffusion MRI. By the end of this course, you should grasp the concepts of diffusion MRI, tractography, and what future directions the field might be heading in. You will also gain practical skills, learning how to perform tractography from start to finish.

## Programme: 

We hope by the end of this week, you should be fully equipped to utilise diffusion MRI in your own research. We have curated and developed a series of tutorials which will start you at diffusion MRI and take you all the way through to deep learning and how it could revolutionise research. 

We have structured the class for those who wish to tackle coding challenges along the way and for those which just want to apply the methodology. As such, the structure of this class will be the following:  

### Day One
1. Presentation: Introduction to the History of Diffusion MRI

2. Practical: Diffusion Tensor Estimation

### Day Two
3. Workshop: Advantages and Disadvantages of the diffusion tensor

4. Practical: Other Methods of Fibre Orientation

 
### Day Three
5. Presentation: Tractography

6. Practical: State of the Art Tractography

### Day Four 
7. Workshop: Advantages and Disadvantages of tractography

8. Practical: Deep DTI

We would recommend following the tutorial with the data we have provided. This is because we have used a fake diffusion scan (known as a phantom) which will be quick to run on everyones computers. 

We hope you have fun! If you have any questions, please contact us using our emails below:
