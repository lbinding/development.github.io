Welcome to the University College London and centre for medical imaging and computing (CMIC) summer school! This is a week long course which aims to introduce you to complex topics so you can apply them to your own research. This course is focused on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), more specifically diffusion MRI. By the end of this course, you should grasp the concepts of diffusion MRI, tractography, and what future directions the field might be heading in. You will also gain practical skills, learning how to perform tractography from start to finish.   

## Who are we?

    <p>Anna studied engineering during her undergraduate, before working as a research assistant for a year studying traumatic brain injury. In 2018, she joined the CDT in medical imaging at UCL. Her current research focusses on modelling the spead of Alzheimer's disease pathology through the brain's structural connectivity network. </p>

    <p>Lawrence completed his undergraduate degree in Psychology and then went on to study neuroimaging for his Masters mainly focused on language and TMS. He joined UCL in 2019 and is now focused on preserving language after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery through avoidance of specific white matter connections. </p>

## Programme: 

We hope by the end of this week, you should be fully equipped to utilise diffusion MRI in your own research. We have curated and developed a series of tutorials which will start you at diffusion MRI and take you all the way through to deep learning and how it could revolutionise research. 

We have structured the class for those who wish to tackle coding challenges along the way and for those which just want to apply the methodology. As such, the structure of this class will be the following:  

### Day One: Diffusion
1. Presentation: Introduction to the History of Diffusion MRI

2. Test: The Diffusion Tensor

3. Practical: Diffusion Tensor Estimation

### Day Two: Tractography
4. Presentation: Introduction to Tractography

5. Test: Tractography

6. Practical: Deterministic Tractography Algorithm

### Day Three: Advanced Tractography
7. Workshop: Advantages and Disadvantages of DTI 

8. MRtrix3: Tractography and Connectome Tutorial

### Day Four: Deep Learning
9. Workshop: Advantages and Disadvantages of tractography

10. Practical: Deep DTI

## Data 

We would recommend following the tutorial with the data we have provided. This is because we have used a fake diffusion scan (known as a phantom) which will be quick to run on everyones computers. Please download it from the following link: *** LINK ***
