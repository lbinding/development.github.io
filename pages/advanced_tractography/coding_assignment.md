Well done! You now have all the tools to perform structural connectome analysis on your own datasets! For those who want a bit of a challenge out of today, there is an additional coding assignment that you can perform yourself. We have the luck of scanning a phantom, this means we have a ground truth of where we should know where tractography runs to (You can find it as GroundTruth.csv). 

--- 

Your coding assignment is to:
* Create connectomes of MRtrix3 and your custom made deterministic tractography.
* Import them into Python 
* Find a way to compare them agains the ground truth! 

This is a great method to see how basic and advanced methods compare despite them using the same principals!
